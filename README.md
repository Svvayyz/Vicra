## Whatâ€™s Implemented

- Modular plugin architecture for extensible detection logic
- Detailed reporting system with severity and categorization
- Object, policy, and callback detection modules
- Windows internals-based process and handle inspection
- Support for analyzing both running processes and static process names

## Planned Features

### Kernel-Mode Features

- **ObCallbacks Enumeration:**  
  - Enumerate kernel-mode object callbacks (`ObRegisterCallbacks`) to detect process/thread/image access filtering and anti-tampering mechanisms.
- **Image Load Notifications:**  
  - Detect and enumerate kernel image load notification routines (`PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine`) to identify monitoring, anti-injection, and anti-cheat features.
- **Process/Thread Notifications:**  
  - Enumerate process/thread creation and termination notification routines for advanced behavioral monitoring.

### Hook Detection

- **SSDT Hooks:**  
  - Identify System Service Descriptor Table hooks commonly used by rootkits and kernel-mode anti-cheat solutions.
- **Inline Hooks:**  
  - Detect code patching at function entry points in both user-mode and kernel-mode modules.
- **EAT (Export Address Table) Hooks:**  
  - Monitor modifications to exported function pointers for user-mode API redirection.
- **IAT (Import Address Table) Hooks:**  
  - Detect tampering of imported function pointers, commonly used for user-mode API hooking.

### Other Planned Features

- **Improved Reporting:**  
  - Export results to various formats (e.g., JSON, CSV)
- **User Interface:**  
  - Basic CLI or GUI for controlling analysis and viewing results
- **Documentation & Examples:**  
  - Expanded code comments, usage guides, and API documentation
- **Unit Tests & Continuous Integration:**  
  - Automated tests for reliability and maintenance
